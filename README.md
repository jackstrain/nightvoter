# nightvoter
Spigot plugin to vote for night on Minecraft servers.  

Many plugins available to allow players to skip night rely on voting for the skip, or for players to sleep. NightVoter allows players to vote to *not* skip night, as night is only required for play in certain cirumstances.

This project is currently abandoned and has been uploaded to preserve the code.  

Features are incomplete and the code is poorly commented in places, with bugs likely to be present.
